# Instructions  

** Implementing a linked list **

Although STL has its own built in list type, we need to understand how they work under the covers.

** Building a linked list ** 

A linked list, as discussed is a data structure which contains data, and a pointer to the next item.
Your task is to implement an LIBRARY representing a generic(templated) linked list.  

1. You will need the following classes, which I've given you templates for:
* LinkedList - The operations you need to implemment are definied in the .h file
* Node - You must define what a node is yourself.  Remember to keep it generic

2.  You must write test code to exercise your class sufficiently.
